# pedometer

Pedometer with Flutter. Tested on Android, but not tested on IOS yet.

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/pedometer.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/pedometer)

This plugin allows for continuous step counting and pedestrian status using the built-in pedometer sensor API of iOS and Android devices.

## Permissions for Android
For Android 10 and above add the following permission to the Android manifest:

```dart
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION" />
```

## Permissions for iOS
Add the following entries to your Info.plist file in the Runner xcode project:

```xml
<key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
<string>This application tracks your steps</string>
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>processing</string>
</array>
```

## Step Count
The step count represents the number of steps taken since the last system boot. 
On Android, any steps taken before installing the application will not be counted.

## Pedestrian Status
The Pedestrian status is either `walking` or `stopped`. In the case that of an error, 
the status will be `unknown`.

## Availability of Sensors
Both Step Count and Pedestrian Status may not be available on some phones:

* It was found that some Samsung phones did not support Step Count or Pedestrian Status
* Older iPhones did not support Pedestrian Status in particular 

There is nothing we can do to solve this problem, unfortunately.

In the case that a sensor is not available, an error will be thrown. It is important that **you** handle this error **yourself**.
## Example Usage

See the [example app](https://github.com/cph-cachet/flutter-plugins/blob/master/packages/pedometer/example/lib/main.dart) for a fully-fledged example.

Below is shown a more generalized example. Remember to set the required permissions, as described above.

``` dart
  Stream<StepCount> _stepCountStream;
  Stream<PedestrianStatus> _pedestrianStatusStream;

  void onStepCount(StepCount event) {
    /// Handle step count changed
    int steps = event.steps;
    DateTime timeStamp = event.timeStamp;
  }

  void onPedestrianStatusChanged(PedestrianStatus event) {
    /// Handle status changed
    String status = event.status;
    DateTime timeStamp = event.timeStamp;
  }

  void onPedestrianStatusError(error) {
    /// Handle the error
  }

  void onStepCountError(error) {
    /// Handle the error
  }

  Future<void> initPlatformState() async {
    /// Init streams
    _pedestrianStatusStream = await Pedometer.pedestrianStatusStream;
    _stepCountStream = await Pedometer.stepCountStream;

    /// Listen to streams and handle errors
    _stepCountStream.listen(onStepCount).onError(onStepCountError);
        _pedestrianStatusStream
        .listen(onPedestrianStatusChanged)
        .onError(onPedestrianStatusError);
    
    ...
  }
```
